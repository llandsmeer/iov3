Comparison between jNML and nmlcc NeuroML to nmodl compilers for arbor

Rocher Smol's v2 IO model

The v2 model can be found in `model_v2`. The `model_v3` directory should be ignored for now as the model is extremely unstable.

```
./nmlcc/target/debug/nmlcc bundle model_v2/C51A.cell.nml model_v2/nmlcc
```
